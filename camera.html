        RED expands its DSMC3 camera system with the V-Raptor XL 8K VV
        Red V-Raptor XL
        The new V-Raptor XL, which leverages the V-Raptor 8K VV + 6K S3 multi-format sensor but places it in an XL camera body, is the latest addition to the RED DSMC3 camera system.
      </h2> 
      <p>The V-Raptor XL incorporates the 8K multi-format sensor housed within the compact and modular V-Raptor body, allowing filmmakers to shoot in 8K wide format, in S35 6K, and even capture up to 600 fps at 2K. The sensor boasts the “highest dynamic range on record”, twice as fast scan time and “cleanest” shadow performance of any RED camera. <br>
    Jarred Land, president of RED, is proud of the new V-Raptor, which he describes as “one of the most innovative cameras we’ve launched”. “The XL builds off our mighty V-RAPTOR and adds more outputs, additional power flexibility and an incredible internal ND system. The entire RED team is so proud of the advancements this brings to cinematographers, and we can’t wait to see what they create,” he concludes.
